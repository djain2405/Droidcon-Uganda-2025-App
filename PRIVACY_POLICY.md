## Introduction

DroidCon Uganda ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use the DroidCon Uganda conference mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally
The DroidCon Uganda app stores the following data locally on your device:

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not track your location
- We do not collect device identifiers

## How We Use Information

The app uses locally stored data solely to:
- Remember your favorite sessions between app launches
- Provide a personalized conference schedule
- Enhance your user experience

## Data Storage and Security

- All data is stored locally on your device
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No user accounts or authentication required
- Uninstalling the app removes all stored data

## Conference Data

The app displays conference information including:

This data is either embedded in the app or fetched from public DroidCon Uganda APIs and does not contain personal user information.

## Children's Privacy

The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for conference attendees and developers.
