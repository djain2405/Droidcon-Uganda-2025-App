## Sample Data 📊

The app includes a rich local dataset featuring:
- 12 conference sessions across 5 tracks (Android, Kotlin, Design, Cloud, Keynote)
- 6 expert speakers from Uganda's tech ecosystem (Jumia, SafeBoda, MTN, Andela, JetBrains, Flutterwave)
- Sessions covering beginner to advanced levels
- Realistic conference schedule (9:00 AM - 4:45 PM EAT)
- **Automatic timezone conversion**: Times stored in East Africa Time (EAT, UTC+3) and displayed in your local timezone

## Running the App 🚀

### Android
```bash
cd DroidConUganda-KMP
./gradlew :composeApp:installDebug
```

Or open in Android Studio and run the app target.

### iOS (requires macOS with Xcode)
1. Open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj
   ```
2. Select the "iosApp" scheme and choose a simulator (e.g., iPhone 15)
3. Click the Run button (▶️) or press Cmd+R
4. The Kotlin framework will be built automatically, then the iOS app will launch

**Note**: The first build may take a few minutes as it compiles the shared Kotlin code into an iOS framework.

### Desktop (JVM)
```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:run
```

## Architecture 🏗️

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with MVVM pattern:

- **Data Layer**: Models and LocalDataSource provide conference data
- **UI Layer**: Composable screens with ViewModel for state management
- **Shared Logic**: 100% of business logic shared across platforms
- **Platform-Specific**: Only UI entry points differ per platform

## Future Enhancements 🚀

- [ ] Connect to real backend API
- [ ] Add session reminders/notifications
- [ ] Implement session search and filtering by track/level
- [ ] Add venue/room maps
- [ ] Enable offline support with local caching
- [ ] Social features (share schedule, attendee chat)
- [ ] QR code ticket integration
- [ ] Speaker Q&A functionality
